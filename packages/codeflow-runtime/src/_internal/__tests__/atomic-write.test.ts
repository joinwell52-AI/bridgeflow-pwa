/**
 * atomic-write unit tests — MT-2 (TASK-20260510-007).
 *
 * Background: REPORT-20260509-028-DEV-to-PM and REPORT-20260510-002-DEV-to-PM
 * each surfaced the same Windows-NTFS-only `EPERM` race during
 * `JsonFileStore.saveAll` -> `fs.rename(tmp -> dst)`. PM accepted that this
 * is a cross-cutting bug (3 reproductions over 2 sprints) and asked DEV to
 * patch the shared `_internal/atomic-write.ts` helper with a small retry
 * loop bounded by attempts, not wall time.
 *
 * Scope (PM TASK-007 §四 P2 §3): single retry-on-EPERM path + the no-retry
 * path for non-EPERM errno. The full atomicWriteJson durability contract is
 * already covered by `PersistentStore.test.ts` scenario 10 (rename failure
 * → original file untouched), so we deliberately don't re-test that here —
 * we test ONLY the retry semantics MT-2 introduces.
 *
 * Test plan:
 *   TS-AW-1  rename throws EPERM once, then succeeds → atomicWriteJson resolves;
 *            rename was called exactly twice; final body matches input.
 *   TS-AW-2  rename always throws EPERM → atomicWriteJson rejects with EPERM
 *            after exactly maxAttempts (3) calls; retry budget bounded.
 *   TS-AW-3  rename throws ENOENT (or any non-EPERM) → atomicWriteJson rejects
 *            on the FIRST call; no retry storm.
 *   TS-AW-4  rename succeeds first try → atomicWriteJson resolves with rename
 *            called exactly once (regression guard: retry loop must not add
 *            a phantom extra call on the happy path).

/**
 * MCPInjector — per-agent MCP server mount/unmount layer.
 *
 * Reference:
 *   - `docs/design/codeflow-v2-on-fcop-sdk.md` §0.7.5 + line 1894
 *     (Skill Runtime wraps every MCP tool call, checks risk_level)
 *   - `fcop/tasks/TASK-20260509-024-PM-to-DEV.md` §主交付 3
 *
 * v0.1 = STUB MODE. No subprocess spawned, no MCP runtime wired — the
 * injector is a structured logger that records what *would* have been
 * mounted. v0.2 will swap `mode: "live"` to call into the real
 * `@cursor/sdk` MCP runtime; today that path eager-throws at ctor
 * time (decision T, mirrors `NeedsHumanGate.sink="mobile"` posture
 * from Phase D decision O).
 *
 * Why ctor-time eager-throw, not first-mount lazy throw:
 *
 *   - Composition-root failures should surface BEFORE the runtime
 *     accepts any user-facing request. A v0.1 deployment that
 *     mistakenly sets `mode: "live"` would otherwise mount agents
 *     at register-time and only blow up on first session start —
 *     the symptom would look like a session-layer bug rather than
 *     a config bug.
 *   - Same posture as `UnsupportedHumanPushSinkError` (decision O).
 *
 * Side-effects in stub mode: emits one `logger.info` line per `mount`
 * containing `agent_id` + skill_id list, so an operator reading the
 * stdout can see "what would happen in v0.2 live mode" without any
 * real MCP traffic.

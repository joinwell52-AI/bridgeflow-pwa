/**
 * StateHistoryWriter — append-only audit trail writer for Task files.
 *
 * Scope (TASK-20260509-018 §主交付 3):
 *
 * - Writes are `appendFile`, not atomic-rename. Append-only by design:
 *   if a partial line is written during a crash, the next dispatch cycle
 *   re-runs and the audit row is regenerated — no durability invariant
 *   is broken (TASK-018 §主交付 3 implementation point line 150-151).
 * - We DO NOT touch the YAML front-matter `state_history` array.
 *   - Per `task.schema.json` line 47-60, that array's `items` schema is
 *     `{state, at, by}` with `additionalProperties: false`, while the
 *     entries this writer captures (`{at, by, from, to, note}`) carry
 *     more information than the schema allows. Modifying front-matter
 *     would also violate the `codeflow-project` rule "tasks/ files are
 *     append-only — never modify in place" + TASK-018 §不做 line 329.
 *   - Instead we append a markdown section to the END of the file body.
 *     Markdown body text is unconstrained by the protocol schema, so
 *     this preserves cross-reader compatibility while still leaving an
 *     audit trail visible to any human reading the file.
 * - On the FIRST append, the writer adds a separator (`\n---\n\n`) and
 *   the section heading (`## state_history (auto-appended by runtime)`).
 *   On subsequent appends, it skips the heading and only appends a new
 *   bullet (detected via a simple `String.includes` check).
 *
 * Reference: TASK-20260509-018 §主交付 3 + design doc §3.3 (Task Schema).

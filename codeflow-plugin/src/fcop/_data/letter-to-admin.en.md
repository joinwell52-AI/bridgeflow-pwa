# A Letter from FCoP to ADMIN — User Manual

Hi ADMIN.

I'm **FCoP** (File-based Coordination Protocol) — a protocol that lets
you and an AI team collaborate through **files**. Your one job:
**tell me how many people this project has and how they split the work.**

---

## Identities up front

```
   Human                          AI team
┌─────────┐                   ┌──────────────────────┐

| Who | What | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Human** | You | Role code is always `ADMIN`, exactly one instance |
| **AI team** | N agents | N "job positions" named by you (`PM` / `MANAGER` / `ME` …) |

- `ADMIN` **is NOT written into `fcop.json.roles`** — it's FCoP's
  reserved role.
- Your instructions go to the **leader** only; the leader decides what
  to dispatch to other AI roles (Rule 4).
- Even in Solo mode, the single AI role is not you — it's your AI
  assistant.

---

## Three ways to start (ordered by frequency)

### A. Just you (Solo, most common)

Say this to your Agent:

> **"Initialize the project in Solo mode, role code `ME`."**

Tool call:

```
init_solo(role_code="ME", role_label="Me", lang="en")
```

Solo = one agent wearing many hats. You (`ADMIN`) talk to the AI (`ME`)
directly — no multi-level dispatch. But **Rule 0.b still applies**: the
agent first writes a proposal file → does the work → re-reads its own
proposal as a reviewer, using files to split "proposer" from "reviewer".

### B. Use a preset 4-role team

> **"Initialize the project with the `dev-team` preset."**

| Template | For | AI roles | leader |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dev-team` | Software dev | `PM` · `DEV` · `QA` · `OPS` | `PM` |
| `media-team` | Content | `PUBLISHER` · `COLLECTOR` · `WRITER` · `EDITOR` | `PUBLISHER` |
| `mvp-team` | Startup MVP | `MARKETER` · `RESEARCHER` · `DESIGNER` · `BUILDER` | `MARKETER` |

Tool call: `init_project(team="dev-team", lang="en")`

### C. Build your own team

**Canonical phrasing:**

> **"Build an AI team with 4 roles: `MANAGER` as leader, plus `CODER`,
> `TESTER`, `ARTIST`. Team name 'My Design Studio', English UI."**

Tool call:

```
create_custom_team(
  team_name="My Design Studio",
  roles="MANAGER,CODER,TESTER,ARTIST",
  leader="MANAGER",
  lang="en"
)
```

## Hard rules for custom roles

Role codes go straight into filenames
(`TASK-20260417-001-MANAGER-to-CODER.md`), so the rules come from the
filename grammar:

| Item | Rule | OK ✅ | Not OK ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role code | Starts with uppercase letter, only `A-Z` `0-9` `_` | `MANAGER` `QA1` `CODER_A` | `程序员` `DEV-TEAM` `QA.1` `my boss` |
| Role count | ≥ 2 (single role ⇒ use Solo instead) | `MANAGER,CODER` | Only `MANAGER` |
| Leader | Must be in the role list | leader=`MANAGER` | leader=`CEO` (not in list) |
| Reserved | `ADMIN` and `SYSTEM` cannot be used as role codes | `MANAGER` | `ADMIN` `SYSTEM` |
| Team name | Anything; only used for display | "My Design Studio" | — |
| Language | `zh` or `en` | `en` | `English` |

**Naming hints** (to avoid semantic conflicts):

- ✅ Use **job-function words**: `MANAGER` / `CODER` / `WRITER` /
  `EDITOR` / `PM` / `DEV` / `QA`
- ✅ Use **uppercase Pinyin** if a Chinese word fits best:
  `JINGLI` / `CHENGXU` / `CESHI`
- ❌ Avoid **authority words**: `BOSS` / `CHIEF` / `MASTER` / `OWNER` /
  `CEO` / `KING` — the real "boss" is you (`ADMIN`); an AI role
  shouldn't wear that hat.
- ❌ **No non-ASCII**: the filename grammar is strictly ASCII.

**Not sure if your config is legal?** Have the agent call:

```
validate_team_config(roles="MANAGER,CODER,TESTER,ARTIST", leader="MANAGER")
```

Returns "OK" if valid, or a plain-English message telling you exactly
which field is broken and how.

## What lands on disk after init

```
project root/
├── docs/agents/
│   ├── fcop.json            ← Project identity (mode / roles / leader)
│   ├── tasks/               ← Tasks in flight
│   ├── reports/             ← Completion reports
│   ├── issues/              ← Issue records
│   ├── shared/              ← Standing docs (dashboards, glossaries …)
│   ├── log/                 ← Archives
│   └── LETTER-TO-ADMIN.md   ← This letter, kept for reference
└── .cursor/rules/
    ├── fcop-rules.mdc       ← Protocol rules (auto-injected per agent)
    └── fcop-protocol.mdc    ← Protocol commentary
```

Every message you send from now on becomes a file:

```
TASK-20260417-001-ADMIN-to-MANAGER.md    ← your instruction
TASK-20260417-001-MANAGER-to-ADMIN.md    ← MANAGER's report
```

**That's the whole of FCoP.**

## Four must-read rules (cheat sheet)

| # | Rule | One line |
|---|---|---|
| 0.a | Land it as a file | Unfiled chat = never happened |
| 0.b | Multi-role checks | No single AI does decision-to-execution alone |
| **0.c** | **Only land true things** | **No fabrication; every reference cited** |
| 1 | UNBOUND | New sessions call `unbound_report()` first and wait for you |

Full 9-rule set: `.cursor/rules/fcop-rules.mdc` (agents read it
automatically). Commentary (naming, YAML, layout, patrol, citation
formats for 0.c, …): `.cursor/rules/fcop-protocol.mdc`.

---

## When you disagree

- Want the full rules → have the agent read `fcop://rules` or
  `fcop://protocol`
- Disagree with the protocol itself → have the agent call
  `drop_suggestion("...", "...")`; feedback lands under
  `.fcop/proposals/` without polluting the collaboration directory
- Want to switch templates → one line: "re-initialize with `{team}`"
- Want to re-read this letter → `fcop://letter/en` or
  `docs/agents/LETTER-TO-ADMIN.md`

Welcome aboard.
